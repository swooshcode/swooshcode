🌟 Check out this mind-blowing CSS animation I created! 🚀✨ Immerse yourself in the Star Wars universe with a stunning 3D model of an X-Wing Fighter spaceship taking flight! The animation employs the magic of "translate3D" and "rotate" properties, effortlessly maneuvering the spaceship in the vastness of 3D space.
This captivating animation allows you to experience the mesmerizing illusion of the X-Wing Fighter soaring through the depths of deep space. The backdrop itself emanates cosmic allure, composed of twinkling stars in perpetual motion, complementing the spaceship's interstellar journey.
Prepare to be blown away by the ingenuity of CSS animations and 3D modeling. It's a perfect showcase of what can be achieved with these technologies! Your eyes won't believe the cosmic wonders you're about to witness! 🌌✨🚀

<h1> Who am I? </h1>
  <p> 🍯 I'm a Lead Software Developer with a passion for coding and solving complex challenges. I have experience in the software development industry, and I'm proficient in a wide range of technologies, including UX/UI design, XCode, TESTFLIGHT, web development, web funnels, C#, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Python, PHP, ASP.NET, Node.js, React, Redux, Angular, Bootstrap, MongoDB, AWS, Azure, Git, Linux, Agile, Scrum, REST API, Machine Learning, Data Structures & Algorithms, Web Services, Cloud Computing, Design Patterns, Testing & Debugging, Networking, Security, DevOps, and Ruby on Rails.
    
In my previous role as Lead Software Developer at ChitChat, I was responsible for leading a team of developers in the development of a new software product. I was also responsible for the overall design and architecture of the product. I have a proven track record of success in delivering high-quality software products on time and within budget.
    
Here you will find direct links to my GitHub repositories and a collection of my written pieces including articles and blog posts about software development.
    
At the moment, I am engrossed in a number of open-source projects, which include:

1. Python Animation: American Flag 🦅🇺🇲 (Complete)-> This code draws the American flag. Using Matplotlib, I designed a canvas and added red and white stripes to represent the flag. I also included a blue rectangle for the stars representing the states. The stars were placed in rows, and the code set various properties to ensure the flag looked just right. It's a wonderful way to create the American flag using computer programming!

This plugin I have been honored to work on will automate speech with Google's Text-To-Speech API. The closed pull request can be found here: https://lnkd.in/gpzSThzY

It is still a work in progress and will be reopened soon to merge with this codebase: https://lnkd.in/gzQ6MnwX
