Quantum Challenge Completed! üí•

I am excited to share with you that I have successfully completed a fascinating challenge in quantum computing! My objective was to design my first quantum circuit utilizing Grover's algorithm while meeting specific qubit constraints. üë®üèø‚Äçüî¨

The circuit involved:
- 10 control qubits
- 1 target qubit
- At least 2 auxiliary qubits

I used the Classiq Technologies platform and Python to define the circuit constraints and optimize them for depth. Additionally, I created an MCX gate to meet the exact qubit requirements. üéØ

Witnessing the circuit diagram come together based on the parameters I set was an incredible experience. Although the challenge was relatively simple, it provided me with a glimpse of what genuine quantum circuit design entails. I am eagerly looking forward to exploring more possibilities with quantum computing! üöÄ
If you are interested in discussing all things quantum, sincerely let me know! Furthermore, do you have any suggestions for other fun quantum challenges for beginners? I would sincerely appreciate hearing them.

P.S. ---> While basic, it was super exciting to synthesize and execute my first quantum circuit. üë®üèø‚Äçüî¨

Hello everyone! I'm excited to share that my latest project is finally complete. I've created a 3D animation model of Poe Dameron's T-70 X-Wing starfighter from the Star Wars franchise. As an animation enthusiast and software developer, it was a great experience for me to merge my passions with my love for Star Wars.

üåü Check out this mind-blowing CSS animation I created! üöÄ‚ú® Immerse yourself in the Star Wars universe with a stunning 3D model of an X-Wing Fighter spaceship taking flight! The animation employs the magic of "translate3D" and "rotate" properties, effortlessly maneuvering the spaceship in the vastness of 3D space.
This captivating animation allows you to experience the mesmerizing illusion of the X-Wing Fighter soaring through the depths of deep space. The backdrop itself emanates cosmic allure, composed of twinkling stars in perpetual motion, complementing the spaceship's interstellar journey.
Prepare to be blown away by the ingenuity of CSS animations and 3D modeling. It's a perfect showcase of what can be achieved with these technologies! Your eyes won't believe the cosmic wonders you're about to witness! üåå‚ú®üöÄ

In these challenging times, this project reminds us of what brings us together. Whether you are a long-time fan of the original trilogy or have just discovered the franchise, the stories of Star Wars resonate with us on a deep level.

My hope is that this project brings joy and inspiration into your lives and reminds you that there are still things that can connect us and bring hope. 3D animations are not just pixels on a screen; they represent our collective imagination, our thirst for adventure, and our yearning to explore a universe beyond our own.
Without further ado, please check out my 3D animation of Poe Dameron's T-70 X-Wing! May the Force be with you, always.
